# Minesweeper Project

This project is a laboratory implementation on the subject of C++. While implementing the laboratory ones, I also chose the game Minesweeper and declared its basic structures. The game in this case consists of two main components: the playing field and game logic.

## Project Structure

- `board.cpp` and `board.h`: Implementation of the Minesweeper game board, including initialization and display.
- `field.cpp` and `field.h`: Definition of the `field` enum representing different cell states (empty, bomb).
- `game.cpp` and `game.h`: Minesweeper game logic, including bomb placement and win-check.
- `main.cpp`: Main program to run the Minesweeper game.
